# Sudoku Solver Visualization in Godot

Visualizes the solving process of a Sudoku. Works with any Sudoku. The algorithm is decoupled from the UI, so that a different algorithm can be used to solve the Sudoku. 

This C++ algorithm was ported to GDScript for this project: https://github.com/afroewis/sudoku-solver
